HAR Extractor
---

HAR Extractor is a minimal application to extract files out of the HAR format. 
The HAR-content is taken directly from your clipboard and is instantly converted into standalone files. 
Therefore, no .har files are needed. 

Please note that you have to have the HAR-content in your clipboard when using this tool!
Also make sure to select a suiting and valid base folder (e.g `D:\Documents`).
